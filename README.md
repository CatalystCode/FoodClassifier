# Ping An Nutrition Doctor - Image Classifier

During the Microsoft One Week Hackathon, we [Microsoft] collaborated with Ping An to build Nutrition Doctor. Nutrition Doctor is an application that allows users to take a photo of a food item whereupon the app will identify the food item and present the user with nutritional information such as calories, fat, etc.
